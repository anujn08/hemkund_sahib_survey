# Char Dham Pilgrimage Travel Survey — v3

A browser-based survey instrument for studying travel behaviour, transport preferences, and service quality perceptions of pilgrims on the Char Dham Yatra (Yamunotri · Gangotri · Kedarnath · Badrinath) in Uttarakhand, India.

Developed at the **Transportation Simulation Lab (TSim Lab)**, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Roorkee, under Prof. Amit Agarwal.

## Purpose

The survey collects primary data on:

- Trip planning and party composition
- Physical mobility and health status of pilgrims
- Main-haul and last-mile transport mode choices
- Stated preferences across service attributes (Discrete Choice Experiment)
- Accommodation and halt patterns along the route
- Satisfaction ratings for transport and facilities
- Socio-demographic profile of respondents

Data are used to calibrate agent-based and discrete choice transport models for the Char Dham corridor.
